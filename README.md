The steps  are : 
Detecting the line (read the floor and setup QTR-TRESHOLD with reflectance sensors array)

Calculating the time the robot took to detect the line then use the same time amount to stop it when reversing

turn the robot to right or left after reaching the point

the bump + collision detecting in case
